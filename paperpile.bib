  abstract = "Recent studies have revealed the importance of feedbacks between
              contemporary rapid evolution (i.e. evolution that occurs through
              changes in allele frequencies) and ecological dynamics. Despite
              its inherent interdisciplinary nature, however, studies on
              eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been mostly ecological and tended
              to focus on adaptation at the phenotypic level without
              considering the genetic architecture of evolutionary processes.
              In empirical studies, researchers have often compared ecological
              dynamics when the focal species under selection has a single
              genotype with dynamics when it has multiple genotypes. In
              theoretical studies, common approaches are models of quantitative
              traits where mean trait values change adaptively along the
              fitness gradient and Mendelian traits with two alleles at a
              single locus. On the other hand, it is well known that genetic
              architecture can affect short-term evolutionary dynamics in
              population genetics. Indeed, recent theoretical studies have
              demonstrated that genetic architecture (e.g. the number of loci,
              linkage disequilibrium and ploidy) matters in eco-evolutionary
              dynamics (e.g. evolutionary rescue where rapid evolution prevents
              extinction and population cycles driven by (co)evolution). I
              propose that theoretical approaches will promote the synthesis of
              functional genomics and eco-evolutionary dynamics through models
              that combine population genetics and ecology as well as nonlinear
              time-series analyses using emerging big data. This article is

              advantage has been debated. From the 1950s, as a result of

              Hybrids survive well under some ecological conditions, but not

              limit rapid polygenic adaptation. This model includes population
              genetic terms of mutation and both directional and stabilizing
              selection on a highly polygenic trait in a diploid population of
              finite size. First, we derived the equilibrium distribution of
              the allele frequencies of the multilocus model by diffusion
              approximation. This formula describing the equilibrium allele
              frequencies as a mutation-selection-drift balance was examined by
              computer simulation using parameter values inferred for human
              height, a well-studied polygenic trait. Second, assuming that a
              sudden environmental shift of the fitness optimum occurs while
              the population is in equilibrium, we analyzed the adaptation of
              the trait to the new optimum. The speed at which the trait mean
              approaches the new optimum increases with the equilibrium genetic
              variance. Thus, large population size and/or large mutation rate
              may facilitate rapid adaptation. Third, the contribution of an
              individual locus i to polygenic adaptation depends on the
              compound parameter $\gamma$ i p i 0 q i 0 , where $\gamma$ i is
              the effect size, p i 0 the equilibrium frequency of the
              trait-increasing allele of this locus, and q i 0 = 1 - p i 0 .
              Thus, only loci with large values of this parameter contribute
              coherently to polygenic adaptation. Given that mutation rates are
              relatively small, this is more likely in large populations, in

              overharvesting and exotic species. Thus, it is relevant to many
              conservation situations. First, habitat fragmentation might
              influence the potential of a population to adapt in response
              environmental degradation. Second, certain harvesting strategies

              span a range of genetic assumptions, including identical loci

              predictions of how populations will evolve and respond
              demographically to ongoing environmental change. The heritability
              (h2) of selected traits has long been known to affect
              evolutionary and demographic responses to environmental change.
              However, effects of the genetic architecture underlying the h2 of
              a selected trait on population responses to selection are less
              well understood. We use deterministic models and stochastic
              simulations to show that the genetic architecture underlying h2
              can dramatically affect population viability during environmental
              change. Polygenic trait architectures (many loci, each with a
              small phenotypic effect) conferred higher population viability
              than genetic architectures with the same initial h2 and
              large-effect loci under a wide range of scenarios. Population
              viability also depended strongly on the initial frequency of
              large-effect beneficial alleles, with moderately low initial
              allele frequencies conferring higher viability than rare or
              already-frequent large-effect alleles. Greater population
              viability associated with polygenic architectures appears to be
              due to higher short-term evolutionary potential compared with
              architectures with large-effect loci. These results suggest that

              Recent advances in genome sequencing and eco-evolutionary
              modeling are unlocking the potential for integrating genomic
              information into predictions of population responses to
              environmental change. Using eco-evolutionary simulations, we
              demonstrate that hypothetical single-locus control of a life
              history trait produces highly variable and unpredictable
              harvesting-induced evolution relative to the classically applied
              multilocus model. Single-locus control of complex traits is
              thought to be uncommon, yet blocks of linked genes, such as those
              associated with some types of structural genomic variation, have
              emerged as taxonomically widespread phenomena. Inheritance of
              linked architectures resembles that of single loci, thus enabling
              single-locus-like modeling of polygenic adaptation. Yet, the
              number of loci, their effect sizes, and the degree of linkage
              among them all occur along a continuum. We review how linked
              architectures are often associated, directly or indirectly, with
              traits expected to be under selection from anthropogenic
              stressors and are likely to play a large role in adaptation to
              environmental disturbance. We suggest using single-locus models
              to explore evolutionary extremes and uncertainties when the trait
              architecture is unknown, refining parameters as genomic
              information becomes available, and explicitly incorporating
              linkage among loci when possible. By overestimating the
              complexity (e.g., number of independent loci) of the genomic
              architecture of traits under selection, we risk underestimating
              the complexity (e.g., nonlinearity) of their evolutionary

  author   = "H{\"o}llinger, Ilse and Pennings, Pleuni S and Hermisson, Joachim",
  abstract = "Evolutionary theory has produced two conflicting paradigms for
              the adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics
              views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci
              underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective
              response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele
              frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is
              largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor
              each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the
              architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as
              resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis.
              The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of
              potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to
              small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a
              newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching
              processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation
              dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an
              expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the
              end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the
              polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when
              phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a
              single compound parameter, the population-scaled background
              mutation rate $\Theta$bg, explains the main differences among
              these patterns. For a focal locus, $\Theta$bg measures the
              mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background
              that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation
              starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe
              different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation
              proceeds by sweeps for small $\Theta$bg ≲ 0.1, while small
              polygenic allele frequency shifts require large $\Theta$bg ≳ 100.
              In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous
              pattern of partial sweeps at several interacting loci.",

              adaptation have been proposed: selective sweeps wherein large
              shifts in the allele frequencies occur at a few loci and
              evolution via small changes in the allele frequencies at many
              loci. Although the first process has been thoroughly investigated
              within the framework of population genetics, the latter is based

              throughout the genome. Selection acting on these traits involves
              co--ordinated allele-- frequency changes at these underlying
              variants, and this process has been extensively studied in
              random--mating populations. Yet many species self-- fertilise to
              some degree, which incurs changes to genetic diversity,
              recombination and genome segregation. These factors cumulatively
              influence how polygenic selection is realised in nature. Here, we
              use simulations to investigate to what extent self--fertilisation
              affects polygenic adaptation to a new environment. We find that
              self--fertilisation can incur a fitness advantage through purging
              maladaptive genotypes. While the degree of self-- fertilisation
              has little influence on how quickly a population adapts to a new
              optimum, those with the highest long--term fitness tended to have
              high levels of selfing (at least 90\%). Very high levels of
              self--fertilisation (99\% and above) causes fixation of variants
              with compensatory effects in elevated linkage disequilibrium
              across the genome. Conversely, if mutations are pleiotropic then
              only a few major--effect variants fix along with many neutral
              hitchhikers, with a transient increase in linkage disequilibrium.
              If deleterious mutations are also present then linkage--block
              formation is disrupted in highly--selfing species, with fewer
              mutations contributing to adaptation and less chance of
              high--linkage genomes persisting over time. We also show how
              these outcomes differ in outcrossing populations with rescaled
              mutation and recombination rates, demonstrating that elevated
              homozygosity also influences the selection response. These
              results show potential advantages to self--fertilisation when
              adapting to a new environment, and how the mating system affects

  title     = "Rapid evolution: from genes to communities, and back again?",
  author    = "Ellner, Stephen P",
  abstract  = "Summary Ecologists now recognize that ecologically important
               traits sometimes undergo large heritable changes on the same
               time‐scale as ecological change (`rapid' or `contemporary'
               evolution). We know much less about the meanings of `sometimes'
               (how often?) and `important' (how important?). I review some of
               what I and my collaborators have learned about rapid evolution
               and suggest some of its implications. Rapid evolution is common:
               when conditions change, traits evolve. But the rate of change is
               hard to predict, even across a set of published laboratory
               predator--prey experiments, and very similar trait changes can
               result from very different molecular mechanisms, even within one
               species. Evolutionary rescue (adaptive response to a detrimental
               environmental change) is common, but not always effective. The
               full range is observed, from little to almost complete
               compensation for environmental change. Cases of limited
               compensation show that strong selection is necessary, but not
               sufficient for rapid adaptation. The response of the copepod
               Onychodiaptomus sanguineus to fluctuating predation shows that
               the time‐scale of environmental variation is important. The
               response of Daphnia galeata to eutrophication shows that
               life‐history trade‐offs and constraints can prevent evolution
               from buffering the entire life history against environmental
               changes. Eco‐evolutionary dynamics are harder to predict when
               traits affecting multiple interactions evolve. Theory predicted,
               and experiments confirmed, a much larger range of possible
               evolutionary outcomes when a prey species evolves defences
               against two predators rather than one. These and other recent
               findings suggest that the devil is in the details: many subtle
               factors, such as how trade‐offs depend on resource availability,
               can have large effects on eco‐evolutionary dynamics. Ecologists
               are increasingly engaged in predicting the ecological effects of
               human impacts such as species introductions and climate change.
               Forecasting evolutionary responses is part of that challenge.
               One implication of the `newest synthesis' is that rapid
               adaptation to changing conditions is nothing new, so the past
               and present can tell us a lot about the future. If prediction is
               our goal, then developing predictive theory for eco‐evolutionary
               dynamics, and testing it in tractable model systems, should be a
               priority.",

              field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently
              developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher, Thornton,
              Ashander, \& Ralph, 2018), which stores the genealogical history
              of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an
              advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral
              mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations
              and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational
              efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed
              extremely efficiently after the fact, using ``recapitation''; (3)
              it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical
              trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact
              representation of a population's genealogy that can be analysed
              in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the
              tree-sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a free, open-source
              evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to
              allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening
              the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and
              performance of this approach, we showcase several practical
              applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously
              existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modelling and

              approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
              tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those
              loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral
              variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a
              succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package
              msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed
              afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires
              storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal
              of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem
              by providing an algorithm to quickly 'simplify' a tree sequence
              by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes.
              By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the
              extant population, we show that the total storage space required
              is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over
              classical forward-time simulations. We implement a
              general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying
              genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any
              population model more efficient. We modify two popular

              observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of
              one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method
              for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal
              genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather
              than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M
              polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making
              it feasible to store a simulation's entire final generation as
              well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized
              with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The

              interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our
              understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation is still
              limited. To address this limitation, we use extensive
              forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of variation in
              demography, trait genetics, and selection on the rate and mode of
              adaptation and the resulting genetic architecture. We simulate a
              population adapting to an optimum shift, modeling sequence
              variation for 20 QTL for each of 12 different demographies for
              100 different traits varying in the effect size distribution of
              new mutations, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the
              contribution of the genomic background. We then use random forest
              regression approaches to learn the relative importance of input
              parameters in determining a number of aspects of the process of
              adaptation, including the speed of adaptation, the relative
              frequency of hard sweeps and sweeps from standing variation, or
              the final genetic architecture of the trait. We find that
              selective sweeps occur even for traits under relatively weak
              selection and where the genetic background explains most of the
              variation. Though most sweeps occur from variation segregating in
              the ancestral population, new mutations can be important for
              traits under strong stabilizing selection that undergo a large
              optimum shift. We also show that population bottlenecks and
              expansion impact overall genetic variation as well as the
              relative importance of sweeps from standing variation and the
              speed with which adaptation can occur. We then compare our
              results to two traits under selection during maize domestication,
              showing that our simulations qualitatively recapitulate
              differences between them. Overall, our results underscore the
              complex population genetics of individual loci in even relatively
              simple quantitative trait models, but provide a glimpse into the

              evolution in nature reveal a very different picture, with strong
              selection and rapid heritable trait changes being common. The
              time-rate scaling of phenotypic evolution suggests that selection

              phenotypes to respond rapidly to environmental fluctuations while
              remaining within relatively constant bounds over longer periods.
              Whether such rapid phenotypic evolution undermines the standard

               ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they
               have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological
               interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type
               go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary
               dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors
               have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by
               comparing it to the overall distribution of measured
               evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly
               interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to
               impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid
               evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly
               enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological
               change. Using this definition we propose a framework for
               decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by
               simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a
               non‐evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population
               dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to
               be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to
               ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other
               factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a
               theoretical predator--prey interaction [Abrams, P. \& Matsuda,
               H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system
               the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate
               is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose
               analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field
               situations, and apply them to two long‐term data sets for which
               suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data
               sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been
               found when measured as character change in standard deviations
               per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in
               response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R.

               has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2.

              Over-the-edge transplant experiments and ecological niche models

              taken advantage of a combined approach for inferring the causes

  abstract = "Understanding the maintenance of genetic variation remains a
              central challenge in evolutionary biology. Recent empirical
              studies suggest the importance of temporally varying selection,
              as allele frequencies have been found to fluctuate substantially
              in the wild. However, previous theory suggests that the
              conditions for the maintenance of genetic variation under
              temporally fluctuating selection are quite restrictive. Using
              mathematical models, we demonstrate that maternal genetic
              effects, whereby maternal genotypes affect offspring phenotypes,
              can facilitate the maintenance of polymorphism in temporally
              varying environments. Maternal effects result in mismatches
              between genotypes and phenotypes, thereby buffering the influence
              of selection on allele frequency. This decreases the magnitude of
              allele-frequency fluctuations and creates conditions for the
              maintenance of variation when selection causes fluctuations.
              Therefore, maternal effects may result in a temporal storage
              effect (``maternal storage effect''). On the other hand, when
              selection does not cause fluctuations (e.g., linear negative
              frequency-dependent selection), maternal genetic effects moderate
              the relative importance of selection compared to genetic drift
              and promote stochastic allele extinction in finite populations.
              Thus, maternal effects can play an important role in the
              maintenance of polymorphism, but the direction of the effect
              depends on the nature of selection.",

  abstract = "The long-running debate about the role of selection in
              maintaining genetic variation has been given new impetus by the
              discovery of hundreds of seasonally oscillating polymorphisms in
              wild Drosophila, possibly stabilized by an alternating
              summer-winter selection regime. Historically, there has been
              skepticism about the potential of temporal variation to balance
              polymorphism, because selection must be strong to have a
              meaningful stabilizing effect-unless dominance also varies over
              time (``reversal of dominance''). Here, we develop a simplified
              model of seasonally variable selection that simultaneously
              incorporates four different stabilizing mechanisms, including two
              genetic mechanisms (``cumulative overdominance'' and reversal of
              dominance), as well as ecological ``storage'' (``protection from
              selection'' and boom-bust demography). We use our model to
              compare the stabilizing effects of these mechanisms. Although
              reversal of dominance has by far the greatest stabilizing effect,
              we argue that the three other mechanisms could also stabilize
              polymorphism under plausible conditions, particularly when all
              three are present. With many loci subject to diminishing returns
              epistasis, reversal of dominance stabilizes many alleles of small
              effect. This makes the combination of the other three mechanisms,
              which are incapable of stabilizing small effect alleles, a better
              candidate for stabilizing the detectable frequency oscillations

              of rainfall affected the fitness of 517 natural Arabidopsis lines
              that were grown in Spain and Germany. This allowed us to directly
              infer selection along the genome3. Natural selection was
              particularly strong in the hot-dry location in Spain, where 63\%
              of lines were killed and where natural selection substantially
              changed the frequency of approximately 5\% of all genome-wide
              variants. A significant portion of this climate-driven natural
              selection of variants was predictable from signatures of local
              adaptation (R2 = 29-52\%), as genetic variants that were found in

              population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such
              signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the
              specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge
              from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this
              knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to
              identify traits that may have been influenced by local
              adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of
              the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean
              additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many
              populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use
              a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary
              number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure.
              Based on this model, we develop methods for detecting unusually
              strong correlations between genetic values and specific
              environmental variables, as well as a generalization of
              [Q(ST)/F(ST)] comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic

              considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents

              adaptation involves evolution at a single locus. We consider
              adaptation using either new mutations or alleles from the
              standing genetic variation that begin rare. We obtain several
              results: i) the total probability of evolutionary rescue from
              either new mutation or standing variation; ii) the conditions
              under which rescue is more likely to involve a new mutation
              versus an allele from the standing genetic variation; iii) a
              mathematical description of the U-shaped curve of total
              population size through time, conditional on rescue; and iv) the
              time until the average population size begins to rebound as well
              as the minimal expected population size experienced by a rescued
              population. Our analysis requires taking into account a subtle
              population-genetic effect (familiar from the theory of genetic
              hitchhiking) that involves ``oversampling'' of those lucky
              alleles that ultimately sweep to high frequency. Our results are
              relevant to conservation biology, experimental microbial
              evolution, and medicine (e.g., the dynamics of antibiotic

              In particular, the auxiliary variable model allows one to deal

              genotyping data on 18 French cattle breeds were analyzed, leading
              to the identification of 13 strong signatures of selection. Among

              environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in
              local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an
              imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral
              correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to
              shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of
              methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns
              and correlations between environmental variables and allele
              frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a
              Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv.
              Using this model, we calculate a set of ``standardized allele
              frequencies'' that allows investigators to apply tests of their
              choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and
              covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by
              showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect
              nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these
              correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to
              outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized
              allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs
              that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This
              test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more
              powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend
              the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools-a

              one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The

              its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose

              population size, many instances of strong selection and rapid

              rescue to harden sweeps from standing variance or new mutation

              marginally test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
              successfully identified many loci with major and minor effects in
              many GWAS. In plant, the relatively small population size in GWAS
              and the high genetic diversity found in many plant species can
              impede mapping efforts on complex traits. Here we present a novel
              haplotype-based trait fine-mapping framework, HapFM, to
              supplement current GWAS methods. HapFM uses genotype data to
              partition the genome into haplotype blocks, identifies haplotype
              clusters within each block, and then performs genome-wide
              haplotype fine-mapping to prioritize the candidate causal
              haplotype blocks of trait. We benchmarked HapFM, GEMMA, BSLMM,

              Moreover, it resulted in smaller mapping intervals, especially in
              regions of high LD, achieved by prioritizing small candidate
              causal blocks in the larger haplotype blocks. In the Arabidopsis

              HapFM is tailored for plant GWAS to result in high mapping power

  title    = "Polygenic Adaptation to an Environmental Shift: Temporal Dynamics
              of Variation Under Gaussian Stabilizing Selection and Additive
              Effects on a Single Trait",
  author   = "Thornton, Kevin R",
  abstract = "Predictions about the effect of natural selection on patterns of
              linked neutral variation are largely based on models involving
              the rapid fixation of unconditionally beneficial mutations.
              However, when phenotypes adapt to a new optimum trait value, the
              strength of selection on individual mutations decreases as the
              population adapts. Here, I use explicit forward simulations of a
              single trait with additive-effect mutations adapting to an
              ``optimum shift.'' Detectable ``hitchhiking'' patterns are only
              apparent if (i) the optimum shifts are large with respect to
              equilibrium variation for the trait, (ii) mutation rates to
              large-effect mutations are low, and (iii) large-effect mutations
              rapidly increase in frequency and eventually reach fixation,
              which typically occurs after the population reaches the new
              optimum. For the parameters simulated here, partial sweeps do not
              appreciably affect patterns of linked variation, even when the
              mutations are strongly selected. The contribution of new
              mutations vs. standing variation to fixation depends on the
              mutation rate affecting trait values. Given the fixation of a
              strongly selected variant, patterns of hitchhiking are similar on
              average for the two classes of sweeps because sweeps from
              standing variation involving large-effect mutations are rare when
              the optimum shifts. The distribution of effect sizes of new
              mutations has little effect on the time to reach the new optimum,
              but reducing the mutational variance increases the magnitude of
              hitchhiking patterns. In general, populations reach the new
              optimum prior to the completion of any sweeps, and the times to
              fixation are longer for this model than for standard models of
              directional selection. The long fixation times are due to a
              combination of declining selection pressures during adaptation
              and the possibility of interference among weakly selected sites
              for traits with high mutation rates.",

               of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of
               plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses
               should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.
               Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of
               results on the original or even new data. However,
               reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an
               analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the
               field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is
               equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The
               former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer
               extended or slightly different research questions. The latter

              skew",
  author   = "Yeaman, Sam and Guillaume, Fr{\'e}d{\'e}ric",
  abstract = "Quantitative genetics models have been used to predict the
              constraints on local adaptation caused by gene flow between
              populations under migration-selection balance. One key assumption
              of this approach is that genetic values within a population are
              normally distributed. Gene flow, however, may generate
              distributions that are skewed toward the immigrant's mean value.
              If the response to selection from a skewed distribution is
              different from that expected under the assumption of normality,
              models may result in inaccurate predictions. We use
              individual-based computer simulations to explore this problem,
              comparing our results to a recent model developed by Hendry et
              al. (2001). We show that this model underestimates the
              equilibrium divergence between populations at migration-selection
              balance. The extent of this underestimation is correlated with
              the amount of genetic skew generated by migration and is partly
              explained by the fact that the analytical model ignores direct
              selection against hybrid phenotypes. We also show that all else
              being equal, response to selection in a population with a skewed
              distribution of genotypes is greater than in a population with
              normally distributed genotypes. The production of skew under
              migration-selection balance, however, is itself dependent upon
              the genetic architecture, with greater deviations from normality
              produced when alleles contributing to population differentiation
              have very different effect sizes. We find that both the skew and
              discrepancies between the models are greatest at intermediate
              migration rates and moderate to strong selection, which is
              exactly the region of parameter space that is most empirically
              relevant.",
